Exercise 35: Branches and Functions
You have learned to do if-statements, functions, and arrays. Now it’s time to bend your mind. Type this in, and see if you can figure out what it’s doing.

print "This room is full of gold. How much do you take?"
next = raw_input("> ")
if "0" in next or "1" in next:
how_much = int(next) else:
dead("Man, learn to type a number.")
if how_much < 50:
print "Nice, you're not greedy, you win!" exit(0)
else:
dead("You greedy bastard!")
def bear_room():
print "There is a bear here."
print "The bear has a bunch of honey."
print "The fat bear is in front of another door." print "How are you going to move the bear?" bear_moved = False
while True:
next = raw_input("> ")
if next == "take honey":

elif next == "taunt bear" and not bear_moved:
print "The bear has moved from the door. You can go through it now." bear_moved = True

What You Should See
Here’s me playing the game:
Extra Credit
1. Draw a map of the game and how you flow through it.
2. Fix all of your mistakes, including spelling mistakes.
3. Write comments for the functions you do not understand. Remember doc comments?
4. Add more to the game. What can you do to both simplify and expand it.
5. The gold_room has a weird way of getting you to type a number. What are all the bugs in this way of doing it? Can you make it better than just checking if “1” or “0” are in the number? Look at how int() works for clues.
