Exercise 5: More Variables and Printing

Python code

```
my_name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
my_age = 35 # not a lie
my_height = 74 # inches
my_weight = 180 # lbs
my_eyes = 'Blue'
my_teeth = 'White'
my_hair = 'Brown'

print "Let's talk about %s." % my_name
print "He's %d inches tall." % my_height
print "He's %d pounds heavy." % my_weight
print "Actually that's not too heavy."
print "He's got %s eyes and %s hair." % (my_eyes, my_hair)
print "His teeth are usually %s depending on the coffee." % my_teeth

# this line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
print "If I add %d, %d, and %d I get %d." % (
    my_age, my_height, my_weight, my_age + my_height + my_weight)
```

R code

```{r}
my_name <- 'Zed A. Shaw'
my_age <- 35 # not a lie
my_height <- 74 # inches
my_weight <- 180 # lbs
my_eyes <- 'Blue'
my_teeth <- 'White'
my_hair <- 'Brown'

sprintf("Let's talk about %s.", my_name)
sprintf("He's %d inches tall.", my_height)
sprintf("He's %d pounds heavy.", my_weight)
sprintf("Actually that's not too heavy.")
sprintf("He's got %s eyes and %s hair.", my_eyes, my_hair)
sprintf("His teeth are usually %s depending on the coffee.", my_teeth)

# this line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
sprintf("If I add %d, %d, and %d I get %d.", my_age, my_height, my_weight, my_age + my_height + my_weight)
```
