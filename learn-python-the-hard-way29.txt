Exercise 29: What If
Here is the next script of Python you will enter, which introduces you to the if-statement. Type this in, make it run exactly right, and then we’ll try see if your practice has paid off.
    people = 20 cats = 30 dogs = 15
if people < cats:
print "Too many cats! The world is doomed!"
if people > cats:
print "Not many cats! The world is saved!"
if people < dogs:
print "The world is drooled on!"
if people > dogs:
print "The world is dry!"
dogs += 5
if people >= dogs:
print "People are greater than or equal to dogs." if people <= dogs:
print "People are less than or equal to dogs."
if people == dogs:
print "People are dogs."

 Extra Credit
In this extra credit, try to guess what you think the if-statement is and what it does. Try to answer these questions in your own words before moving onto the next exercise:
1. What do you think the if does to the code under it?
2. Why does the code under the if need to be indented 4 spaces?
3. What happens if it isn’t indented?
4. Can you put other boolean expressions from Ex. 27 in the if-statement? Try it. 5. What happens if you change the initial variables for people, cats, and dogs?
