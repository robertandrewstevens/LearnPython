Exercise 10: What Was That?
In Exercise 9 I threw you some new stuff, just to keep you on your toes. I showed you two ways to make a string that goes across multiple lines. In the first way, I put the characters \n (back-slash n) between thenamesofthemonths.Whatthesetwocharactersdoisputanew line characterintothestring at that point.
This use of the \ (back-slash) character is a way we can put difficult-to-type characters into a string. There are plenty of these “escape sequences” available for different characters you might want to put in, but there’s a special one, the double back-slash which is just two of them \\. These two characters will print just one back-slash. We’ll try a few of these sequences so you can see what I mean.
Another important escape sequence is to escape a single-quote ’ or double-quote ". Imagine you have a string that uses double-quotes and you want to put a double-quote in for the output. If you do this "I "understand" joe." then Python will get confused since it will think the " around "understand" actually ends the string. You need a way to tell Python that the " inside the string isn’t a real double-quote.
To solve this problem you escape double-quotes and single-quotes so Python knows to include in the string. Here’s an example:
The second way is by using triple-quotes, which is just """ and works like a string, but you also can put as many lines of text you as want until you type """ again. We’ll also play with these.
"I am 6'2\" tall." # escape double-quote inside string 'I am 6\'2" tall.' # escape single-quote inside string
     tabby_cat = "\tI'm tabbed in." persian_cat = "I'm split\non a line." backslash_cat = "I'm \\ a \\ cat."
fat_cat = """ I'll do a list: \t* Cat food \t* Fishies
\t* Catnip\n\t* Grass
"""

     print tabby_cat print persian_cat print backslash_cat print fat_cat

What You Should See
Look for the tab characters that you made. In this exercise the spacing is important to get right.
    $ python ex10.py
I'm tabbed in.
I'm split
on a line.
I'm \ a \ cat.
I'll do a list:
        * Cat food
$
* Fishies
* Catnip
* Grass

Search online to see what other escape sequences are available.
Use ”’ (triple-single-quote) instead. Can you see why you might use that instead of """? Combine escape sequences and format strings to create a more complex format.
Remember the %r format? Combine %r with double-quote and single-quote escapes and print them out. Compare %r with %s. Notice how %r prints it the way you’d write it in your file, but %s prints it the way you’d like to see it?
