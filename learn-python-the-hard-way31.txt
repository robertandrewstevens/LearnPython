Exercise 31: Making Decisions
In the first half of this book you mostly just printed out things and called functions, but everything was basically in a straight line. Your scripts ran starting at the top, and went to the bottom where they ended. If you made a function you could run that function later, but it still didn’t have the kind of branching you need to really make decisions. Now that you have if, else, and elif you can start to make scripts that decide things.
In the last script you wrote out a simple set of tests asking some questions. In this script you will ask the user questions and make decisions based on their answers. Write this script, and then play with it quite a lot to figure it out.

A key point here is that you are now putting the if-statements inside if-statements as code that can run. This is very powerful and can be used to create “nested” decisions, where one branch leads to another and another.
Make sure you understand this concept of if-statements inside if-statements. In fact, do the extra credit to really nail it.

Make new parts of the game and change what decisions people can make. Expand the game out as much as you can before it gets ridiculous.
