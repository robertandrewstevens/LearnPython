Exercise 4: Variables And Names

Python code

```
cars = 100
space_in_a_car = 4.0
drivers = 30
passengers = 90
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers
cars_driven = drivers
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven


print "There are", cars, "cars available."
print "There are only", drivers, "drivers available."
print "There will be", cars_not_driven, "empty cars today."
print "We can transport", carpool_capacity, "people today."
print "We have", passengers, "to carpool today."
print "We need to put about", average_passengers_per_car, "in each car."
```

R code

```{r}
cars <- 100
space_in_a_car <- 4.0
drivers <- 30
passengers <- 90
cars_not_driven <- cars - drivers
cars_driven <- drivers
carpool_capacity <- cars_driven * space_in_a_car
average_passengers_per_car <- passengers / cars_driven


cat("There are", cars, "cars available.\n")
cat("There are only", drivers, "drivers available.\n")
cat("There will be", cars_not_driven, "empty cars today.\n")
cat("We can transport", carpool_capacity, "people today.\n")
cat("We have", passengers, "to carpool today.\n")
cat("We need to put about", average_passengers_per_car, "in each car.\n")
```
