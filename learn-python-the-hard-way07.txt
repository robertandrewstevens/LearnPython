Exercise 7: More Printing
Now we are going to do a bunch of exercises where you just type code in and make it run. I won’t be explaining much since it is just more of the same. The purpose is to build up your chops. See you in a few exercises, and do not skip! Do not paste!
    print "Mary had a little lamb."
print "Its fleece was white as %s." % 'snow' print "And everywhere that Mary went."
print "." * 10 # what'd that do?
end1 = "C" end2 = "h" end3 = "e" end4 = "e" end5 = "s" end6 = "e" end7 = "B" end8 = "u" end9 = "r" end10 = "g" end11 = "e" end12 = "r"
# watch that comma at the end.  try removing it to see what happens
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6, print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12

Go back through and write a comment on what each line does. Read each one backwards or out loud to find your errors.
From now on, when you make mistakes write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake you made.
When you go to the next exercise, look at the last mistakes you made and try not to make them in this new one.
Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who like everyone to think they are perfect and never wrong, but it’s all an act. They make mistakes all the time.
